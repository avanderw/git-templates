The ever-so-lovely code drops. Patches with hundreds of lines of code to dump a new feature into the code while at the same time rewriting half the existing infrastructure to support this feature. As a result, those hundreds of lines of code need to be reviewed every time a bug is discovered that is somehow related to that area of code.
It's easier and less time consuming to first rework the infrastructure one piece at a time, then plug the new feature on top. As a side-effect, if a project relies on code dumps too often it's discouraging outside developers. Would you like to contribute to a project where the time spent filtering the signal from the noise outweighs the actual contribution to the code?
