Short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text. Wrap it to 72 characters. The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely).

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages
generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too.

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space. 

- Use a hanging indent.
```

## Subject line (required)

- Limit to 50 characters
- Minimum x characters

### Do not end with a period
Do you write your emails with an ending period? Use that 2% of your summary length better.

### Do not use AND
Split your commits rather.

- Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph

### Use the imperative mood

Start the summary with common verbs. Common verbs will help keep the summary short. A short summary aids in separating out the body. Common verbs naturally reduce the use of definite articles. The summary will better match the ticket title. As the ticket is generally written before the work is done.

```
- Add a new feature
- Remove bad piece of code
- Update dependency
- Refactor function or method
- Fix an old bug
```

## Body (optional)

- Describe any limitations this commit introduces

## Metadata (optional)

- Put metadata at the end of the commit message
